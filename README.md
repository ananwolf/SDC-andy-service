# System Design Capstone

> This Project is the Back-End database management for Hack Reactor bootcamp
> in this repo I have a legacy database
> in which I need to Extrace, Transform, and Load into 2 new Databases.
> Then tested with K6 and Loader.io to check for area of optimization
> and compare which Database is best suited for the project.
